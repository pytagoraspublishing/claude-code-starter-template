Update the current development feature by:

1. Find the USERNAME of the currently logged in user in the terminal.
2. Check if `.claude/features/USERNAME/.current-feature.md` exists to find the active feature
2. If no active feature, inform user to start one with `/project:feature:start`
3. If feature exists, append to the feature file with:
   - Current timestamp
   - The update: $ARGUMENTS (or if no arguments, summarize recent activities)
   - Git status summary:
     * Files added/modified/deleted (from `git status --porcelain`)
     * Current branch and last commit
   - Todo list status:
     * Number of completed/in-progress/pending tasks
     * List any newly completed tasks
   - Any issues encountered
   - Solutions implemented
   - Code changes made

Keep updates concise but comprehensive for future reference.

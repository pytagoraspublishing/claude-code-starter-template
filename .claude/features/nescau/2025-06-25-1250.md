## Session Summary

### Session Duration
**End Time:** 2025-06-25 12:55 PM  
**Total Duration:** ~5 minutes (brief session)

### Git Summary
**Files Modified:**
- `install.sh` - Modified to add non-interactive mode support

**Commits Made:** 0 (changes pending commit)

**Final Git Status:**
- Modified: `install.sh`
- Modified: `.claude/settings.local.json`
- Several test directories created (test-install, test-interrupt, test-external)

### Todo Summary
**Total Tasks:** 5 (All Completed ✅)

**Completed Tasks:**
1. ✅ Add non-interactive mode detection to install.sh
2. ✅ Modify remote handling for non-interactive mode  
3. ✅ Modify file conflict handling for non-interactive mode
4. ✅ Modify cleanup for non-interactive mode
5. ✅ Test the non-interactive mode

**Incomplete Tasks:** None

### Key Accomplishments

1. **Made install.sh Non-Interactive Compatible**
   - Added detection for piped execution using `[ -t 0 ]`
   - Script now runs without any user prompts when piped through curl
   - Preserves interactive mode when run directly

2. **Improved User Experience**
   - Users can now run: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pytagoraspublishing/claude-code-starter-template/main/install.sh | bash`
   - No manual intervention required for automated setups
   - Clear indication when running in non-interactive mode

### Features Implemented

1. **Non-Interactive Mode Detection**
   - Detects if script is running through a pipe/non-TTY
   - Sets `INTERACTIVE` variable accordingly

2. **Automatic Conflict Resolution**
   - Remote conflicts: Automatically removes and re-adds existing template remotes
   - File conflicts: Safely skips existing files (no overwrites in non-interactive mode)
   - Cleanup: Automatically removes template remote after completion

3. **Mode-Specific Behavior**
   - Interactive mode: All original prompts preserved
   - Non-interactive mode: All decisions automated with safe defaults

### Problems Encountered and Solutions

1. **Problem:** Script was exiting early due to `set -e` when users didn't respond to prompts
   - **Solution:** Commented out `set -e` to prevent early exit on user choices

2. **Problem:** Script hanging when piped through curl due to waiting for user input
   - **Solution:** Implemented non-interactive mode that bypasses all prompts

3. **Problem:** Difficulty testing from outside the repository
   - **Solution:** Created multiple test directories to simulate different scenarios

### Breaking Changes or Important Findings

- No breaking changes for existing users
- Script maintains backward compatibility
- Non-interactive mode uses conservative defaults (skip existing files)

### Dependencies Added/Removed
- None

### Configuration Changes
- Modified `.claude/settings.local.json` (added curl to allowed bash commands)

### Deployment Steps Taken
- Changes need to be committed and pushed to GitHub
- Once pushed, the curl pipe command will work without user intervention

### Lessons Learned

1. **TTY Detection is Crucial**: Using `[ -t 0 ]` effectively detects piped execution
2. **Safe Defaults Matter**: In non-interactive mode, skipping existing files prevents accidental data loss
3. **User Feedback**: Even in non-interactive mode, clear output helps users understand what's happening

### What Wasn't Completed

- Changes haven't been committed/pushed yet
- Could add a `--force` flag for overwriting files in non-interactive mode
- Could add more command-line options for customization

### Tips for Future Developers

1. **Testing Non-Interactive Scripts**: Use `echo | ./script.sh` to simulate piped input
2. **Preserve Both Modes**: Always maintain interactive mode for direct execution
3. **Clear Output**: Non-interactive doesn't mean silent - provide feedback
4. **Safe Defaults**: When in doubt, choose the option that won't lose user data
5. **Consider Edge Cases**: Test with existing files, missing directories, etc.

### Next Steps
1. Commit the changes to install.sh
2. Push to GitHub repository  
3. Test the curl pipe command from a fresh directory
4. Consider adding command-line flags for more control
